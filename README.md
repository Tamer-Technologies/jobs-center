## 🧩 TypeScript Philosophy

The following principles guided all TypeScript decisions in this project:

### 1. `type` vs `interface`

- Use **`type`** when defining a closed unit that is unlikely to change  
  (e.g. domain values, unions, visual mappings)
- Use **`interface`** when:
  - Extending existing types
  - Defining component props
  - Expecting future extension

This improves readability and long-term maintainability.

### 2. Domain Types vs UI Types

All domain-related types (Jobs, Status, Metadata) live outside components.

Components:

- Consume types
- Do not define business meaning

This keeps UI flexible and domain logic reusable across pages.
